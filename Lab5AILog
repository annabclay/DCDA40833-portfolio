Typography enhancements:

Larger, bolder caption with better letter spacing
Improved line height for better readability
Consistent font sizing across all text elements
Visual hierarchy:

Clear separation between caption, description, skills, and links
Left-aligned description and details for better readability
Added subtle background to skills section with left border accent
Spacing & Layout:

Better padding and margins throughout
Centered text blocks with max-width for optimal reading
Subtle gradient background on text container
Professional details:

Cleaner link styling with underline on hover instead of text decoration
Removed italic style from skills section
Better color contrast and visual consistency
The text now has a more polished, professional appearance with improved readability and visual hierarchy!

some of the text is cut off anfd i need it to not look cut off

Fixed! The changes I made to prevent text cutoff:

Auto height - Changed from fixed 600px to min-height with height: auto so the carousel expands to fit all content
Image size limit - Set a maximum height of 350px for images (250px on mobile) instead of 85%, giving more room for text
Better overflow handling - Changed overflow: hidden to overflow: visible and adjusted slide alignment from center to flex-start
Added padding - Added proper padding to carousel-slide to ensure text doesn't touch edges
The carousel will now automatically adjust its height to display all content without any text being cut off!

now it is cutting off my work so make this so mothing is covered

Changed active slide positioning - Active slides now use position: relative instead of absolute, so they take up proper space in the layout
Hidden inactive slides - Inactive slides remain absolutely positioned and hidden with visibility: hidden so they don't interfere with layout
Added bottom margin - Increased carousel bottom margin to 4rem (3rem on mobile) to ensure proper spacing from content below
Better overflow control - Restored overflow: hidden on carousel container to prevent content from bleeding out
Added padding - Extra bottom padding on slides to ensure content has breathing room
Now the carousel won't cover the "My Work" section or any other content below it!
