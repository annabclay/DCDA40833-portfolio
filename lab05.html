            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This lab focused on developing web development skills with AI assistance. Throughout the project, I documented my collaboration with AI tools to show how they supported my learning process.

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
                When doing this lab I wanted to make my website as personalized as possible. On past websites, I have used a light/dark toggle. I added this in, but also wanted to try the more advanced options. The new features I added were the carousel and the accessibility improvements. The pages I changed the most were index.html, style.css, and carousel.js. I added all my comments to style.css and created an AI log of the questions I was asking.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Dark Mode Implementation:</strong> During this lab, I used Claude Sonnet 4.5 to help me add in the new features and learn what they meant. The AI helped me create a dark mode system using CSS variables. This made sense to me because the colors were defined in one place and then also reused across the site.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Carousel Development:</strong> For the carousel, Claude Sonnet created the layout for the switching slides. I added a link to my old website with projects on it to the chat. I asked the bot to add old projects from this website to the carousel. It was slightly confusing at first, but it eventually worked, and I added new photos to the cover. The slides work by hiding the others using properties like opacity, visibility, and positioning. In my log, you can see that the AI didn't get things perfect at first. There was one point where I asked it to "make the website look cooler," and it messed everything up. I ended up undoing everything and have to start my work over. This taught me that AI isn't perfect all the time, and I need to be very specific with my requests.

            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <p>
                When creating my comments, I was trying to teach myself what was happening when I was confused. Some of the parts I did not understand at first were <code>.dot</code> and <code>nth-child()</code>. After asking the bot what dot meant, I learned that it was a navigation indicator for switching slides. These dots are shown on the website. Another part I was confused about at first was the child command. This was in the hamburger section, and I learned that each line in the hamburger is a "child". It targets specific lines so it can animate them into an "X". I think I can understand each command when explained to me, but I wouldn't recognize all of them yet. For example, I am slightly confused about the accessibility comments when there are animation delays, but I understand it is making the view better for people with discomfort to animations.

                When considering the question "If a classmate read my portfolio page, would they understand exactly what the AI contributed, what I contributed, and what I'm still figuring out?" they would understand. I attached the AI log to my lab 5 so I can give credit for the AI's work.
