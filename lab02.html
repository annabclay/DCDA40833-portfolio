            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                When choosing what AI tools to compare, I chose ChatGPT and Google Gemini. I use ChatGPT for my schoolwork and everyday life, usually, so I am very familiar with the types of responses it uses. For this exercise, I gave both of the platforms similar prompts to see how they would respond. The first prompt I gave it was “What are some easy meals I can make as a college student?” The second prompt I gave the platforms was “What would be some good design ideas for a VS Code website?” Both have similar suggestions, but the way they delivered was very different.

            <h2>Tool 1: ChatGPT</h2>

            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>
                When I asked ChatGPT about the meals, it provided me with pictures and ingredient lists, and it spoke to me as if it were my friend. For example, after I asked, it responded, “Okayyy college-friendly meals coming right up 🍽️ — easy, cheap, minimal effort, minimal dishes (because I know the vibe).” This has a conversational feel rather than feeling like instructions. I feel like I am collaborating and tailoring the meals to my preferences rather than getting step-by-step instructions.

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>
                The same pattern appeared in the second prompt about VS Code website design. I think that ChatGPT is best for brainstorming and drafting with personalized responses. It might struggle to be serious and to achieve complete accuracy.

        <section>
            <h2>Tool 2: Google Gemini</h2>

            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>
                When I asked the same question to Google Gemini, the response was more professional and had no photos. After I asked what meals to mak,e it responded with “Ah, the classic college culinary struggle: trying to eat something that isn't just a handful of dry cereal, while staying within a 'broke student' budget.” Even though the tone isn’t completely professional, there are no emojis or misspellings in words like “Okayyy”.

                <img src="images/GeniniEX.png" alt="Screenshot of Google Gemini response">

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>
                Google Gemini is best for background research and summaries, but is less helpful for creative projects. Having no photos and less fun responses wouldn’t make me want to go back if I were trying to come up with a creative idea. I would go to Gemini when I needed some facts checked or a quick, easy explanation for everyone, not just me.

            <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
            <p>
                Both of these tools raise concerns about authorship. Where did the information come from? When ChatGPT gave me photos of food, who took them? Am I stealing ideas from someone else? It is hard to know. When brainstorming with either one of these platforms, I need to remember that AI-generated work and ideas aren’t necessarily “original”.

        <section>
            <h2>Broader Reflections</h2>
            <p>
                I imagine using AI tools as a helpful tool in everyday and academic life. If I don't understand a concept and need it broken down, this would be helpful. Making a final decision or continuing with a big creative decision would still be up to me. When writing this paper, I entered all the differences between the two platforms into AI and had it explain some of the key differences it identified. I took these points, noted them, noticed my own, and then wrote this reflection.
            </p>

            <p>
                AI tools in DCDA have helped me so much. If my code isn't working and I don’t know what is wrong, I can ask what I did wrong and how they fixed it/how to avoid the mistake. Sometimes,s even one character can mess up the entire code, and AI is a big help when trying to understand what went wrong. AI can also help me teach new concepts in VS Code when I want to experiment.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the future, when evaluating an AI took some questions I could ask are: Who trained this platform? What data was provided to this platform for training? Is this the best platform for what I need?
