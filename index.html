<p>
  Welcome to my Skills Portfolio for DCDA 40833. This site showcases my work from the past two semesters in digital culture and data analytics.
  Each page features a lab assignment focused on web development, data visualization, or interactive mapping. </p>

<!-- I chose this introduction because I want visitors to know
     about that the I have worked on all of these projects throughout a long period of time. -->
     
    <!-- I also wanted to show that each website highlights a different skill -->

        <!-- About Section: Tell visitors about yourself -->
        <section id="about">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  I'm passionate about how people connect through media and technology and enjoy turning those insights into meaningful, engaging stories. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Strategic Communication from the Bob Schieffer College of Communication with a double major in Digital Culture & Data Analytics at Texas Christian University.
</p>

<p>
  My studies and internships have allowed me to blend strategic thinking, digital creativity, and data analysis to craft content that resonates with specific audiences. Through my internships, I've gained hands-on experience in public relations, social media strategy, content creation, and digital marketing. These opportunities have taught me how to develop campaigns, manage client communications, create engaging content, and use analytics to strengthen audience engagement.
</p>

<p>
  After graduation, I plan to work with a brand in PR or advertising, applying my skills at the intersection of strategy, creativity, and technology. I thrive on collaboration and look forward to working on projects that bring together diverse perspectives and innovative ideas.
</p>
</strong> Through this course, I hope to strengthen my coding skills and continue pushing myself both creatively and technically while building the final website.
</p>

     <!-- I also wanted to show what I am wanting to learn this semester so show how I can grow -->

<section id="reflection">
    <h2>Semester Reflection</h2>

    <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> What was new to me when working on this lab was the .gitkeep and .gitignore placeholder files. I can't remember if we used these last semester, but they are unfamiliar to me. I learned that once the images are added to the folder, they are no longer necessary.</p>

    <p><strong>Challenges I overcame:</strong> When working on this lab, the challenge I faced was VS Code not opening my files. I tried deleting the repository and redownloading it, shutting down my computer, deleting VS Code, watching YouTube videos, and asking for help. After working with my AI assistant on VS code it helped me change some of the viewing settings. The AI assistant reset the explorer view and expanded folder view, refreshed the files explorer, reset the explorer view container location, and collapsed and reset the explorer folders.</p>

    <p><strong>How I grew:</strong> Through this lab, I learned how to troubleshoot technical issues more effectively instead of getting stuck or overwhelmed. Working through the VS Code issues helped me become more confident in using development tools and relying on problem-solving strategies when something does not work as expected.</p>

    <p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong> This semester, I am most looking forward to making a website that reflects my personal interests/hobbies, with lots of graphics and features that I have not worked with before.</p>
